# i.e. everything after the first tab becomes the caption.

1	Prototype, using the Adafruit Atmega32u4 Breakout Board
2	Closeup of the cylindrical light pipe, that emits the 10ms IR pulse.  Some cameras will show that pulse if you take a video.
3	"Finished" installation.  I should replace that bungee cord.
4	You can see the hole for the IR phototransistor in the rubber sheet.
5	Closeup of the IR detector, peering out.  The box and rubber sheet are stuck together with double-sided tape, which is visible here.  I think the tape was for vinyl flooring.  
6	The phototransistor was hot-glued in place.  Besides the IC, there are three components -- a filter cap, a resistor (variable, set to 20K) and the phototransistor.
7	The wire exits through a tight notch drilled in the box.  By not cutting the short rim on the lid of the box (which is the bottom in this application), I hope I added some water resistance.
